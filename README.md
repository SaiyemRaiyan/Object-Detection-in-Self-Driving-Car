# Object-Detection-in-Self-Driving-Car

Develop an object detection system specifically designed for self-driving
cars. The system should be capable of identifying and localizing various objects in real-time,
enabling the self-driving car to make informed decisions about its navigation and behavior on the
road. It is very important to detect objects for self-driven cars. The object detection system must operate in real-time, providing timely information to the
self-driving car's control system. The system should achieve high accuracy in detecting and
classifying different types of objects commonly found on the road, such as pedestrians, vehicles,
traffic signs, traffic lights, cyclists, and obstacles. The system's effectiveness will be evaluated based
on accuracy, processing speed, and localization precision.
